# structs-and-algs
C++ modules of useful data structures, searching algorithms, and sorting algorithms. 

# Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of simply up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You must have [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed on your local machine.

### Installing

Clone the repository in a directory of your choice:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/themarkrizkallah/structs-and-algs.git
```

Once that is done, go into your directory and run:

```
$ mkdir bin
$ make
```

The project is now compiled and ready to run.

If for some reason you wish to clear the object files and executable, run:

```
$ make clean
```

## Running the project

In order to run the project, either `cd` into the bin directory and run:

```
$ ./exec
```

Or run the following command from the project directory:

```
$ ./bin/exec
```

## Modules
Data-structures currently supported:
- DynamicArray
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue

Sorting algorithms currently supported:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort

More modules will be added soon.
